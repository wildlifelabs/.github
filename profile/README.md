**Wildlife Labs** is a research lab dedicated to advancing wildlife conservation through computational research and AI. Our work focuses on mapping and interpreting animal cognition, behaviour, and individuation. 
The aim of this work is to understand human impact on wildlife and support breed-to-release conservation efforts to support declining or extinct-in-the-wild populations, ensuring genetic diversity and species survival.

Our research outputs include open-source tools and AI models to support researchers and conservationists in monitoring, breeding and protecting fauna. 

Committed to the ethical application of AI, we aim to improve animal welfare and conservation outcomes through computational methods.
