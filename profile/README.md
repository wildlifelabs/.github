**Wildlife Labs** is a research lab dedicated to advancing wildlife conservation through computational research and AI. Our work focuses on mapping and interpreting animal cognition, behaviour, and individuation. 

Our research outputs include open-source tools and AI models to support researchers and conservationists in monitoring and protecting fauna. 

Committed to the ethical application of AI, we aim to improve animal welfare and conservation outcomes through computational methods.
